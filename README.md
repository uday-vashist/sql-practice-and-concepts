# SQL Practice and Concepts

This repository documents my journey of learning SQL through hands-on practice and concept-based queries.

Here, I will regularly add SQL work based on what I learn and practice on a daily basis.

It includes:
- SQL solutions to a variety of practice problems 
- Queries demonstrating important SQL concepts (joins, subqueries, window functions, etc.)
- Notes and learnings along the way

The goal is to build strong SQL fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills.
